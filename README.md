# Hi, I’m Digban Mijoghene

### Software engineer | Node.js Engineer | Problem Solver

I’m a **backend-focused software engineer**  building RESTful APIs, database-driven systems, and scalable server-side applications. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, designing clean architectures, and turning ideas into reliable backend solutions.

I’m driven by **continuous learning**, **resilience**, and a strong desire to build systems that work efficiently in real-world scenarios.
